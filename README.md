# Quiz-App
The quiz application which i created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is an interactive and engaging platform that allows users to test their knowledge on various subjects through a series of questions and receive immediate feedback on their performance.

The application provides a visually appealing and intuitive user interface developed using HTML and CSS. The design elements are carefully crafted to enhance the user experience and make navigation through the quiz seamless.

The core functionality of the quiz is implemented using JavaScript. The application dynamically generates a set of questions from a predefined question bank and presents them to the user. The questions can be multiple-choice, true/false, or any other format you have chosen. The JavaScript code ensures that the questions are randomized for each user attempt, providing a fresh experience each time.

Once the user selects their answers and submits the quiz, JavaScript evaluates the responses and calculates the score. The application then displays the results to the user, showing the number of correct and incorrect answers, as well as the overall score. Users can also see their progress throughout the quiz, allowing them to track their performance.

To enhance the interactivity, you may have included additional features such as a countdown timer, allowing users to complete the quiz within a specified time limit. You may have also added hints or explanations for each question to assist users in their decision-making process.

Overall, this quiz application provides an engaging and educational experience for users to test their knowledge on various subjects. It showcases your skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and demonstrates your ability to create interactive web applications. With further development, you can expand the quiz with more topics, add user authentication for personalized experiences, or integrate it with a backend server to store and retrieve quiz data.
